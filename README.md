# ibex_messages
Experiment interface design to format your IbexFarm experiment into a text message conversation

This experimental interface will format your experimental items into a text message conversation. 

Qualitative and quantitative feedback from participants suggests that this interface leads to increased participant engagement.
This format is especially useful for experiments soliciting higher-level judgments, such as those of pragmatic felicity or semantic comprehension.

The naturalistic dialogue-setting encourages participants to read the entire dialogue, allowing the experimenter to control 
context-sensitive properties such as the QuD and focus.
